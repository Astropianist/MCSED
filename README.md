# MCSED

## Background
MCSED models the optical, near-infrared and infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of galactic systems.  In light of the fact that there are so many such codes already publicly available, we describe the motivation for MCSED and highlight areas in which this code stands out from the crowd.  First of all, galaxies over cosmic time span a wide range of parameters related to their baryonic content including total stellar mass, gas and stellar metallcity, dust mass and distribution, and star formation history.  This large variation for the totality of all galaxies makes it extremely difficult to develope a general enough SED fitting code to work for all systems.  Instead, most codes are taylored to work best for specific populations.  

MCSED targets galaxies at cosmic noon (z ~ 1-3) that are selected via their emission lines either in the rest-frame optical or ultraviolet wavelengths.  These sources are drawn from the 3DHST survey (http://3dhst.research.yale.edu/Home.html) as well as the HETDEX survey (http://hetdex.org/).  Initial SED fitting efforts revealed that these systems are star-forming (1-100 solar masses per year over the last 10 Myrs) with low stellar masses (10^7 to 10^10 solar masses).  

We use a monte carlo algorithm, emcee (http://dfm.io/emcee/current/), to then infer the posteriors for fitted parameters such as stellar mass.

## Installation
To acquire and install this code, simply move to a directory where you would like it stored and type:

        git clone https://github.com/grzeimann/MCSED.git

A directory called "MCSED" will be created containing all of the necessary files for the program.  This is a python based code and does require a few standard python based packages.  All of the packages required can be found in the Anaconda distribution environment.  To install Anaconda, see:
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

## How to Run MCSED
The primary script is run_mcsed.py, which can be called from the command line with input arguments.  To view the input arguments, simply type:

        python run_mcsed.py -h

And you will find a help menu like this.
  
        -f, --filename: File to be read for galaxy data
                        
        -s, --ssp: SSP Models, default "fsps"
                        
        -z, --metallicity: Metallicity for SSP models, 0.019 is solar
                        
        -i, --isochrone: Isochrone for SSP model, e.g. "padova"
                        
        -t, --test: Test script with mock data
                        
        -tf, --test_field: Test filters will match the given input field, default "cosmos"
        
All of the available options for MCSED are found in config.py.  Here we break down the most important of those.  At the top, there are four key variables:

        ssp = 'fsps'  # options include: 'fsps'
        isochrone = 'padova'  # options include: 'padova'
        sfh = 'empirical'  # options include: 'double_powerlaw', 'empirical'
        dust_law = 'noll'  # options include: 'noll'

These allow the user to configure the SED fitter to their specifications and give the flexibility and use of many SSP, SFH, and dust law parameterizations.  Although these are far from extensive, they serve as the dominant
